## Choosing a Location for an Oil Well

### Problem Description
Based on data about the quality of oil and its reserves in three regions, the goal is to select a region for drilling oil wells with the lowest risk of incurring losses during product realization.

### Data
The raw data is stored in three CSV files, each containing information about oil samples in three regions, with 10,000 deposits in each region. These deposits include measurements of oil quality and its volume.

### Tools
- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- sklearn
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- random

### Key Steps
1. Data loading, exploration, and the presentation of descriptive statistics using Pandas, including an analysis of feature distributions.
2. Dataset splitting into training and testing sets, training linear regression models, and evaluating predictions using R2 and RMSE.
3. Calculating profits and risk of losses using bootstrap sampling techniques: average profit per region, confidence intervals, and the risk of losses. 
4. Analyzing the results and providing recommendations for region selection for development.
