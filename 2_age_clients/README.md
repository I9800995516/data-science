1. Task Description  
   The network supermarket "Bread-Salt" is implementing a computer vision system for processing customer photos. Photo capture in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:
   - Analyze purchases and suggest products that may interest customers of this age group.
   - Monitor the cashiers' integrity when selling alcohol.
   It is necessary to build a model for the "Bread-Salt" supermarket that will approximate a person's age based on a photo.

2. Data  
   A dataset of 7591 photos of people with their ages specified.

3. Tools  
   - keras
   - PIL
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - seaborn
   - matplotlib

4. Main Steps  
   - Initial data review, examination of photos, and distribution of customer ages.
   - Model building using keras, training on GPU, and evaluation of predictions using MAE.
   - Model analysis, dataset recommendations, and general conclusions.
